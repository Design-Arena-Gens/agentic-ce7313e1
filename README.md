Upload multi-page PDFs, ask natural-language questions, and retrieve precise verbatim excerpts with page-level provenance—all in under ten seconds.

## ✨ Features

- 📄 **Large PDF ingestion**: Extracts full-text from 20+ page lecture notes, manuals, and research papers.
- 🧠 **Semantic retrieval**: Uses transformer-based embeddings to surface the most relevant passages.
- 🔍 **Verbatim answers**: Displays excerpts exactly as they appear in the source, with page and character indices.
- 🖼️ **Visual preview**: Renders the matching PDF page alongside the answer for fast verification.
- ⚡ **Client-side processing**: Runs entirely in the browser—no server-side storage required.
- 🌙 **Responsive UI**: Tailwind-powered experience with dark mode support.

## 🚀 Getting Started
